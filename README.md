JurassiCraft is a mod made to bring prehistoric creatures to the world of Minecraft, inspired by Jurassic Park, but is not limited to all JP canon: as many creatures and features as possible will be added! Creatures are made Jurassic Park style, by obtaining fossils or amber, using the fossils or amber to create DNA, inserting the DNA into eggs, and hatching the eggs.

Feel free to speed up development and create pull requests. Here's a guide on how to setup your workspace.

First, make a fork of this repository. When you've done that, you can clone that reposity. Depending on your installation settings, you either have to run the command in the git Bash, or the CMD/Terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/<Your Username>/JurassiCraft2
```

When that's done, go into the newly created directory `JurassiCraft2` and run in the console if you're on Windows:

```
gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace

Or this when you're on any other operating system (Like Mac OS X and Ubuntu):
```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
... and append the name of the IDE you use - eclipse or idea:

__Example for Windows and IDEA:__
>gradlew.bat setupDecompWorkspace idea

Now open the workspace and voilà, you can start contributing!
